# My-ASD-Journey

##What is My ASD Journey?
My ASD Journey is a mobile mini game collection that tries to simulate some of the experiences of living with ASD. Many of the games are designed in a way that you are meant to lose and overall the app aims to promote empathy with the ASD community.

This app was created by Austin Lubetkin and Kathleen Burkhardt at [NY Chi 2016](http://nychi.tech). My ASD Journey was written in Codea, a simplified but powerful version of Lua.

##You're SUPPOSED to lose?
People on the autism spectrum* often get overwhelmed by sensory stimuli such as loud noises, strong smells, and bright lights, leading to a phenomena called "sensory overload". That, combined with difficulty in social situations, makes it hard for people on the spectrum to do everyday tasks such as participate in "small talk" and identify faces in a large crowd.

##*Disclaimers
This game is based off of our own personal experiences as well as typical characteristics of autistic people, and does not reflect what every autistic person experiences. Autism is a spectrum, and as a spectrum, it affects everyone differently. The effects in this game are purposely over-dramatized so that other people can see a sharper contrast, thus empathize more strongly.
